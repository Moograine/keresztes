# kereszteszs

This project was created with Angular 14.0.0.

It serves only as a landing page for me, and a way to communicate with me. It's also a public repository, so feel free
to check the code, maybe you'll find something useful.

I have a few personal projects, but this is the first 'complete' one, and I wanted to make sure it works with every
device and browser, in every possible scenario. I also tried to use a decent amount of animation, and while I love to
use Angular Animations, I mainly used vanilla CSS with the combination of Typescript. It would be simple to convert
every animation to Angular Animations, but my main goal was to provide a landing page which supports every platform.
Sadly, in many cases, I saw tons of bugs, when I was testing in Safari with Angular Animations.
